# RIPBOZO

![RIPBOZO GIF](docs/images/RIPBOZO-3x.gif)

A twitch bot that plays rock paper scissors between two chatters.
The catch? Chatters must wager their chat privileges.

A chatter can challenge another chatter with the amount of seconds
they want to wager. Default being 5 minutes.

Loser of the game will get timed out for the agreed upon amount. `ripbozo`
